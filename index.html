                <p class="text">Lorem Ipsum is simply the <span class="fancy">dummy text</span> of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the  standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a <span class="fancy">type specimen book</span>. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <h2> Report</h2>
            <p>"Before designing my website, I did some research into the web standards used. I referenced sites such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and considered what they have in common with one another. One such standard is a navigation bar that is placed at the top of each page which allows users to easily navigate through the site. Another is the consistent colour scheme, font and style throughout each page which allows for better readability and keeps the website clean."</p>
            <p>"When designing my website, I considered these standards – putting a navbar at the top of each page and using the same colours and styles."</p>
            <p>"There are also standards put in place by the W3C to enforce conformity between browsers. These are standards such as HTML 5 which provides new elements to all for more complex layouts. Tags such as “section” allow for better readability, making writing and interpreting HMTL and CSS much easier. HTML 5 also removed reliance on third party plug-ins – making websites less demanding and ultimately quicker and more secure."</p> 
            <p>"I utilised these new standards affectively – using the section tag for appropriate “divs”, a video tag for a background video and canvas for my customiser."</p>
